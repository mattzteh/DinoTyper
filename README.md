# jsProject_dinoTyper

Background

Dino Typer is a type racer game where you are running for your life! The motive is to type as fast as you can and complete typing the words given to you. Be careful! A hungry dinosaur has just woken up and is looking for its next meal. If you are too slow, or mistype too much, you will surely be the first prehistoric meal in millions of years.
